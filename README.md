# Gen_AI
his repository contains hands-on lab exercises, mini-projects, and experimental notebooks focused on Generative AI using tools like OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain, and more. Topics include prompt engineering, text &amp; image generation, fine-tuning models, LLM chaining, and real-world use cases. Built as part of my GenAI course/lab work at VTU
